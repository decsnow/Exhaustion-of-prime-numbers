# Exhaustion-of-prime-numbers
## chinese description
这个代码的架构想必是不需要赘述的  
但它不同于其它大多数代码的最大特点是：  
它大大缩减了穷举的计算量  
<u>对于一个确定的大于2的正整数X  
当其不能被大于等于2小于等于根号下X的所有正整数整除时  
算法即判断其是质数</u>  
这一点无疑节省了相当多的计算时间，提高了算法效率。  
如果今后有时间，我会去做具体的对比实验，评估其相对于传统算法的优越性  
## English description(translated by Google)
The structure of this code must not need to be repeated

 But its biggest feature different from most other codes is:

 It greatly reduces the amount of exhaustive calculations

 <u>For a certain positive integer X greater than 2

 When it cannot be divisible by all positive integers greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to the radical X

 The algorithm judges that it is a prime number</u>

 This undoubtedly saves a lot of calculation time and improves the efficiency of the algorithm.

 If I have time in the future, I will do specific comparative experiments to evaluate its superiority over traditional algorithms
